# Deep-image-processing
Hands on for academic lecture

This lecture focus on the use of codes to run and assess deep model. We are interested on image classification and image segmentation. In view of the range of existing models, we use a classical architecture: CNN and UNet.

## Image classification

### CNN

### Task ?

### Code explanation

We give you codes and slides structured as below:
- Efficient library : Tensorflow or Pytorch
- Architecture :
  - Block : Conv and subsampling (transposed, stride, pad)
- Performance measurement for classification task
- Training hyperparameter
- Train model
- Test model

### Conclusion : Classification in practice 

## Image segmentation

### UNet

### Task ?

### Code explanation

We give you codes and slides structured as below:
- Efficient library : Tensorflow or Pytorch
- Architecture : encoder and decoder
  - Block : Conv and subsampling (transposed, stride, pad)
- Performance measurement for classification task
- Training hyperparameter
- Train model
- Test model

### Conclusion : Segmentation in practice 

## Model deployement

### Napari as plugin deployement for public usage

### Conclusion
