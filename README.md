# Deep-image-processing
Hands on for academic lecture

This lecture focus on the use of codes to run and assess deep model. We are interested on image classification and image segmentation. In view of the range of existing models, we use a classical architecture: CNN and UNet.

## Image classification

## Image segmentation
